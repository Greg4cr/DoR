However, we do not know how Java developers have adapted to the functional style of thinking, and more importantly, what are the reasons motivating Java developers to adopt functional programming. Without such knowledge, researchers miss opportunities to improve the state of the art, tool builders use unrealistic assumptions, language designers fail to improve upon their designs, and developers are unable to explore efficient and effective use of lambdas.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We present the first large-scale, quantitative and qualitative empirical study to shed light on how imperative programmers use lambda expressions as a gateway into functional thinking. Particularly, we statically scrutinize the source code of 241 open-source projects with 19,770 contributors, to study the characteristics of 100,540 lambda expressions. Moreover, we investigate the historical trends and adoption rates of lambdas in the studied projects. To get a complementary perspective, we seek the underlying reasons on why developers introduce lambda expressions, by surveying 97 developers who are introducing lambdas in their projects, using the firehouse interview method.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Among others, our findings revealed an increasing trend in the adoption of lambdas in Java: in 2016, the ratio of lambdas introduced per added line of code increased by 54% compared to 2015. Lambdas were used for various reasons, including but not limited to (i) making existing code more succinct and readable, (ii) avoiding code duplication, and (iii) simulating lazy evaluation of functions. Interestingly, we found out that developers are using Java's built-in functional interfaces inefficiently, i.e., they prefer to use general functional interfaces over the specialized ones, overlooking the performance overheads that might be imposed. Furthermore, developers are not adopting techniques from functional programming, e.g., currying. Finally, we present the implications of our findings for researchers, tool builders, language designers, and developers.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/3133909","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,13]],"date-time":"2017-10-13T15:15:45.000Z","timestamp":1507907745000},"page":"1-31","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":27,"title":["Understanding the use of lambda expressions in Java"],"prefix":"10.1145","volume":"1","author":[{"given":"Davood","family":"Mazinanian","affiliation":[{"name":"Concordia University, Canada"}],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"Ameya","family":"Ketkar","affiliation":[{"name":"Oregon State University, USA"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Nikolaos","family":"Tsantalis","affiliation":[{"name":"Concordia University, Canada"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Danny","family":"Dig","affiliation":[{"name":"Oregon State University, USA"}],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"320","reference":{},"container-title":["Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3133909","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,2]],"date-time":"2021-03-02T17:53:36.000Z","timestamp":1614707616000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,12]]},"references-count":62,"journal-issue":{"issue":"OOPSLA"},"alternative-id":["10.1145/3133909"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3133909","relation":{"cites":{}},"ISSN":["2475-1421"],"issn-type":[{"type":"electronic","value":"2475-1421"}]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]],"date-time":"2021-07-06T15:04:21.000Z","timestamp":1625583861353},"publisher-location":"New York, NY, USA","reference-count":42,"publisher":"ACM","isbn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"9781450342186"}],"license":[{"URL":"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#Background","start":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,1]],"date-time":"2016-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","timestamp":1477958400000},"delay-in-days":0,"content-version":"vor"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":[],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2016,11]]},"DOI":"10.1145/2950290.2950305","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,1]],"date-time":"2016-11-01T13:46:03.000Z","timestamp":1478007963000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":77,"title":["Why we refactor? confessions of GitHub contributors"],"prefix":"10.1145","author":[{"given":"Danilo","family":"Silva","affiliation":[{"name":"Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil"}],"sequence":"first"},{"given":"Nikolaos","family":"Tsantalis","affiliation":[{"name":"Concordia University, Canada"}],"sequence":"additional"},{"given":"Marco Tulio","family":"Valente","affiliation":[{"name":"Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil"}],"sequence":"additional"}],"member":"320","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,11]]},"reference":{},"container-title":["Proceedings of the 2016 24th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering"],"original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2950290.2950305","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,21]],"date-time":"2020-12-21T04:12:12.000Z","timestamp":1608523932000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11]]},"ISBN":["9781450342186"],"references-count":42,"alternative-id":["10.1145/2950290.2950305","10.1145/2950290"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2950290.2950305","relation":{"cites":{}}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]],"date-time":"2021-07-06T15:04:21.000Z","timestamp":1625583861495},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","funder":[{"name":"Division of Computing and Communication Foundations","DOI":"10.13039/100000143","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["CCF-1553741"]},{"name":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","DOI":"10.13039/501100000038","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["RGPIN-2018-05095"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["IIEEE Trans.

Instead of supplying the normal inputs to a program (e.g. numbers) one supplies symbols representing arbitrary values. The execution proceeds as in a normal execution except that values may be symbolic formulas over the input symbols. The difficult, yet interesting issues arise during the symbolic execution of conditional branch type statements. A particular system called EFFIGY which provides symbolic execution for program testing and debugging is also described. It interpretively executes programs written in a simple PL/I style programming language. It includes many standard debugging features, the ability to manage and to prove things about symbolic expressions, a simple program testing manager, and a program verifier. A brief discussion of the relationship between symbolic execution and program proving is also included.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/360248.360252","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2002,7,27]],"date-time":"2002-07-27T11:34:59.000Z","timestamp":1027769699000},"page":"385-394","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1471,"title":["Symbolic execution and program testing"],"prefix":"10.1145","volume":"19","author":[{"given":"James C.","family":"King","affiliation":[{"name":"IBM Thomas J.

For instance, a security researcher who has run the fuzzer for a week has currently\n            <jats:italic>no</jats:italic>\n            means (1) to estimate the total number of\n            <jats:italic>feasible</jats:italic>\n            program branches, given that only a fraction has been covered so far; (2) to estimate the additional time required to cover 10% more branches (or to estimate the coverage achieved in one more day, respectively); or (3) to assess the residual risk that a vulnerability exists when no vulnerability has been discovered. Failing to discover a vulnerability does not mean that none exists—even if the fuzzer was run for a week (or a year). Hence, testing provides\n            <jats:italic>no formal correctness guarantees</jats:italic>\n            .\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            In this article, I establish an unexpected connection with the otherwise unrelated scientific field of\n            <jats:italic>ecology</jats:italic>\n            and introduce a statistical framework that models Software Testing and Analysis as Discovery of Species (STADS). For instance, in order to study the species diversity of arthropods in a tropical rain forest, ecologists would first sample a large number of individuals from that forest, determine their species, and extrapolate from the properties observed in the sample to properties of the whole forest. The estimations (1) of the total number of species, (2) of the additional sampling effort required to discover 10% more species, or (3) of the probability to discover a new species are classical problems in ecology. The STADS framework draws from over three decades of research in ecological biostatistics to address the fundamental extrapolation challenge for automated test generation. Our preliminary empirical study demonstrates a good estimator performance even for a fuzzer with adaptive sampling bias—AFL, a state-of-the-art vulnerability detection tool. The STADS framework provides\n            <jats:italic>statistical correctness guarantees</jats:italic>\n            with quantifiable accuracy.\n
