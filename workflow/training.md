# Before you start... do the Training

Before doing real work with the [coding_guide](coding_guide.md), please do the training.

Reuse is not a clear cut yes,no. It is a continium. Somethings are used all the time (e.g. standard statistical methods) and if we declared those to  be "reused" then that could overwhelm our records.

So you need to learn to calibrate when you decide something is reused or not.

To do that, you need to do a training exercise; i..e.

- Read 5 papers that have been analyzed before. Here are the those results. DO NOT LOOK at these until you get your own results.
  - Hint: 
     - Paper1 will take about an hour to skim to look for reused parts
     - atfter that, ypu will speed up and it should abot 15-20 minutes to skims paper2,3,4,5 
- Check that you are getting the same results.

Once you are calibrated, then proceed.
