# IRB Board

For those that  need investigator review board approval for this work, we offer the following notes:

- We will be asking graduate students to list their view of what are the reused items in a paper.
  - No student name will be collected as part of this process
  - Students will be identified by an anonymous id.
- We will be emailing the authors of the reused product (if we can find them) to see if they agree their artifact is being reused.
- We will be emailing the authors of the paper doing the reuse
  (if we can find them) to see if they agree that that artifact is being reused.

Statistics will be applied to check the agreement of these populations
